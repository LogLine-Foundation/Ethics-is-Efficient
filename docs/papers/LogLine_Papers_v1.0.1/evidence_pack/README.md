# Evidence Pack

This directory contains conformance test vectors and evidence artifacts for the LogLine SecurityOS protocols.

## Structure

```
evidence_pack/
├── receipts_trio/        # Paper IV conformance receipts
│   ├── receipt.plan_invalid.json
│   ├── receipt.ghost.json
│   └── receipt.allow.ee082.json
├── fixtures_ab/          # Paper II (JSON✯Atomic) test fixtures
├── sirp_roundtrip/       # Paper V (SIRP) roundtrip tests
└── harness_equiv/        # Cross-paper equivalence harness
```

## Verification

To validate invariants I1–I3 on the demo corpus:

```bash
python tools/replay.py
```

Expected output: `[PASS] I1–I3` on sample intents/receipts/ghosts.

## Conformance Tests

| Test ID | Paper | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| CT-II-* | II | JSON✯Atomic canonicalization vectors |
| CT-III-* | III | LLLV pack verification |
| CT-IV-* | IV | TDLN Gate receipts |
| CT-V-* | V | SIRP capsule roundtrip |

## Note

Full evidence packs are generated by the reference implementation. These placeholders establish the expected structure.
