# We Solved It — Not Google, Not Facebook, Not Amazon, Not OpenAI

**Ethics Is Efficient**: Today I'm publicly disclosing the **LogLine SecurityOS Protocols** — an open, verifiable way for **LLM managers and humans** to act fast **with receipts**.

- **Record→Execute**: intent first, action second.  
- **REQUIRE ≡ needs_consent**: risk‑bearing actions need k‑of‑N human consent.  
- **Receipts or it didn’t happen**: reality is cryptographic, not opinion.  
- **Privacy is policy**: enforced before execution, proven after.  

**Protocol suite:** I LogLine • II JSON✯Atomic • III LLLV • IV TDLN • V SIRP • VI Chip‑as‑Code.  
**Foundations:** A Ethics is Efficient • B Hardware as Text.

> Responsibility, accountability, and privacy are **primitives**, not paperwork. That’s how you get security **and** speed.
