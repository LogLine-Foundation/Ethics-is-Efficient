abstract: >
  LogLine SecurityOS is a complete protocol architecture that inverts the
  fundamental relationship between execution and recording in computational
  systems. The architecture requires that every action be recorded, evaluated
  against policy, and receipted before execution can occur. It introduces
  six interlocking protocols (LogLine, JSON✯Atomic, LLLV, TDLN, SIRP,
  Chip-as-Code) built on two foundational principles (Ethics is Efficient,
  Hardware as Text).
